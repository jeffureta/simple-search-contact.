<h1>simple contact search</h1>

This is a simple contact search web app that allows you to quickly search for phone numbers by name. I used the power of AI, like ChatGPT, to create this app using basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. As a community nurse in Southwest London, I needed a quick way to find the GP's contact number and this app was the perfect solution. It lets you search for contacts by name and provides their phone number.
